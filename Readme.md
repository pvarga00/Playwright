1. Getting Started with Playwright

Installation
First, you’ll need to set up your environment. You can install Playwright using npm: [npm init playwright@latest]

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
npm install playwright
Basic Setup
After installing, you can create a simple script. Here's a basic example that launches a browser and navigates to a website:

javascript
Copy code
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
    const browser = await chromium.launch();
    const context = await browser.newContext();
    const page = await context.newPage();
    
    await page.goto('https://example.com');
    console.log(await page.title());
    
    await browser.close();
})();
2. Understanding the Core Concepts
Browsers: Playwright supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
Context: Represents a single browser session; you can create multiple contexts for parallel tests.
Page: Represents a single tab or page in the browser.
3. Writing Tests
Using Test Runner
Playwright comes with its own test runner, making it easy to write and organize your tests.

Install Playwright Test:

bash
Copy code
npm install -D @playwright/test
Create a Test File: For example, example.spec.ts.

javascript
Copy code
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('homepage has title', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('https://example.com');
    await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Example Domain/);
});
Run Your Tests:

bash
Copy code
npx playwright test
4. Locating Elements
Learn how to interact with elements:

Selectors: Use CSS or XPath selectors.

javascript
Copy code
await page.click('text=More information...'); // Text selector
Assertions: Use expect for assertions.

javascript
Copy code
await expect(page.locator('h1')).toHaveText('Example Domain');
5. Advanced Features
Screenshots & Videos: Capture screenshots or record videos of your tests.

javascript
Copy code
await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });
Network Interception: Mock network requests.

javascript
Copy code
await page.route('**/api/**', (route) => {
    route.fulfill({
        status: 200,
        contentType: 'application/json',
        body: JSON.stringify({ success: true }),
    });
});
6. Running Tests in Parallel
Playwright supports parallel execution. You can set this in your playwright.config.js:

javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
    testDir: './tests',
    timeout: 30000,
    expect: {
        timeout: 5000,
    },
    retries: 1,
    workers: 4, // Number of parallel workers
};
7. Best Practices
Use Page Object Model (POM): Organize your code better by using the POM design pattern.
Keep Tests Independent: Ensure tests can run in isolation.
Use Before/After Hooks: Manage setup and teardown with hooks provided by the test runner.
8. Resources
Official Documentation: Playwright Documentation
Example Projects: Explore GitHub repositories with Playwright examples.
9. Practice
Start by automating simple web applications.
Gradually move on to more complex scenarios, like forms, authentication, and multi-page workflows.

Created a Playwright Test project at C:\Users\pvarg

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npx playwright test
    Runs the end-to-end tests.

  npx playwright test --ui
    Starts the interactive UI mode.

  npx playwright test --project=chromium
    Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.

  npx playwright test example
    Runs the tests in a specific file.

  npx playwright test --debug
    Runs the tests in debug mode.

  npx playwright codegen
    Auto generate tests with Codegen.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

    npx playwright test

And check out the following files:
  - .\e2e\example.spec.ts - Example end-to-end test
  - .\tests-examples\demo-todo-app.spec.ts - Demo Todo App end-to-end tests
  - .\playwright.config.ts - Playwright Test configuration
